# MoonlightTechnologies-Publish

Moonlight Technologies Inc. Public Documents  
This repository is a place where Moonlight Technologies Inc. manages all documents published to address social issues. Here, we share our vision and more.

# Purpose of This Repository

In today's world, where technology permeates every corner of society, the impact of its evolution is immeasurable. As a technology company, we believe it is our responsibility to act for the good of society.

We have three main goals for making this repository public:

1. Ensuring Transparency: We share our thought processes and proposals to enhance the transparency of our decision-making.
2. Gaining Diverse Perspectives: By incorporating feedback and insights from people with various backgrounds, we can refine our proposals beyond what we could achieve internally.
3. Solving Issues through Collective Intelligence: By bringing together the collective intelligence of the community, we aim to co-create more effective solutions for complex social issues that are difficult for a single company to solve.

Ultimately, we sincerely hope that the discussions here will contribute to the realization of a sustainable and inclusive society.
